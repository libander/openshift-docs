////
Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
* file name: proc_installing-your-component.adoc
* ID: [id="installing-your-component_{context}"]
* Title: = Installing {your-component}

Add the following attribute before the module ID:
:_mod-docs-content-type: PROCEDURE

The ID is an anchor that links to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken. The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in an assembly file.
////

[id="installing-your-component_{context}"]

= Installing {your-component}
////
Start the title of a procedure module with a gerund, such as Creating, Installing, or Configuring.

Be sure to include a line break between the title and the module introduction.

Attributes are reusable pieces of text, like variables. They help maintain consistency and make bulk updates easier. Use attributes whenever possible, especially for product names, URLs, or repeated text blocks. Attributes are located at _attributes/common-attributes.adoc
