////
A note for reviewers: This should have been a reference module, but it would be a wasted opportunity to not link to documentation for each feature, and we can't do that in a module because we can't xref in a module. Can't easily nest assemblies either, so instead of a new page just for feature reference, this is the first piece of a getting started assembly, please do not include commented out sections which are in progress in requested reviews..

This start up guide is intended for {logging} deployments using the Loki Operator and Vector Collector.

You can use either the xref:../getting_started/openshift-web-console.adoc[{product-title} web console] or the xref:../getting_started/openshift-cli.adoc[{product-title} CLI] to configure {logging}.

== Before you begin
. Determine the xref:../logging/cluster-logging.adoc#logging-architecture-overview_cluster-logging[types of logs] to collect
. Determine
. Determine Loki xref:../logging/log_storage/installing-log-storage.html#loki-deployment-sizing_installing-log-storage[deployment size].



. Configure xref:../logging/log_storage/installing-log-storage.adoc#logging-loki-storage_installing-log-storage[S3 compatible object storage].
. Create a secret using the configuration provided for the object storage provider:

. Create a LokiStack custom resource (CR) instance in the `openshift-logging` namespace using the xref:../logging/log_storage/installing-log-storage.adoc#create-lokistack-cr-console_installing-log-storage[{product-title} web console] or xref:../logging/log_storage/installing-log-storage.adoc#create-lokistack-cr-cli_installing-log-storage[CLI].
.

. Create a xref:../logging/log_collection_forwarding/configuring-log-forwarding.adoc#logging-create-clf_configuring-log-forwarding[ClusterLogForwarder CR instance] in the `openshift-logging` namespace
.. Configure the xref:../logging/log_storage/cluster-logging-loki.adoc[LokiStack] or
..

your ClusterLogForwarder CR to forward logs to your log store.
