== Bug fixes
*  Before this update, Loki did not correctly load some configurations, which caused issues when using Alibaba Cloud or IBM Cloud object storage. This update fixes the configuration-loading code in Loki, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6294[LOG-6294])

* Before this update, upgrades to version 6.0 failed with errors if a Log File Metric Exporter instance was present. This update fixes the issue, enabling upgrades to proceed smoothly without errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6328[LOG-6328])
