= Initiating the limited live migration process

After you have checked the behavior of egress IP resources, egress firewall resources, and multicast enabled namespaces, and removed any egress router resources, you can initiate the limited live migration process.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster has been configured with the OpenShift SDN CNI network plugin in the network policy isolation mode.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have created a recent backup of the etcd database.
* The cluster is in a known good state without any errors.
* Before migration to OVN-Kubernetes, a security group rule must be in place to allow UDP packets on port `6081` for all nodes on all cloud platforms.
* If the `100.64.0.0/16` and `100.88.0.0/16` address ranges were previously in use by OpenShift-SDN, you have patched them. The first step of this procedure checks whether these address ranges are in use. If they are in use, see "Patching OVN-Kubernetes address ranges".
* You have checked for egress IP resources, egress firewall resources, and multicast enabled namespaces.
* You have removed any egress router pods before beginning the limited live migration. For more information about egress router pods, see "Deploying an egress router pod in redirect mode".
* You have reviewed the "Considerations for limited live migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin" section of this document.

.Procedure

ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
. To add the `unsupported-red-hat-internal-testing` annotation to the cluster-level network configuration, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch Network.config.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' --patch '{"metadata":{"annotations":{"unsupported-red-hat-internal-testing": "true"}}}'
----
endif::[]

. To patch the cluster-level networking configuration and initiate the migration from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch Network.config.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' --patch '{"metadata":{"annotations":{"network.openshift.io/network-type-migration":""}},"spec":{"networkType":"OVNKubernetes"}}'
----
+
After running this command, the migration process begins. During this process, the Machine Config Operator reboots the nodes in your cluster twice. The migration takes approximately twice as long as a cluster upgrade.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
This `oc patch` command checks for overlapping CIDRs in use by OpenShift SDN. If overlapping CIDRs are detected, you must patch them before the limited live migration process can start. For more information, see "Patching OVN-Kubernetes address ranges".
====

. Optional: To ensure that the migration process has completed, and to check the status of the `network.config`, you can enter the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network.config.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.networkType}'
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network.config cluster -o=jsonpath='{.status.conditions}' | jq .

You can check limited live migration metrics for troubleshooting issues. For more information, see "Checking limited live migration metrics".
