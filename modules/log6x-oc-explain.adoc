= Using the `oc explain` command

The `oc explain` command is an essential tool in the OpenShift Command-Line Interface (CLI) that provides detailed descriptions of the fields within Kubernetes resources, including Custom Resources (CRs) introduced by Operators. This command is invaluable for administrators and developers who are configuring or troubleshooting resources in an OpenShift cluster.

. *Resource Descriptions*: It offers in-depth explanations of all fields associated with a specific Kubernetes or Custom Resource. This includes standard resources like pods and services, as well as more complex entities like statefulsets.

. *Hierarchical Structure*: The command displays the structure of resource fields in a hierarchical format, clarifying the relationships between different configuration options. This hierarchical view is crucial for proper configuration.

. *Type Information*: `oc explain` also indicates the type of each field (such as string, integer, or boolean), which is critical for ensuring that resource definitions are provided with correct data types.

. *Default Values*: When applicable, the command shows the default values for fields, providing insights into what values will be used if none are explicitly specified.
