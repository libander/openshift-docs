= OpenShift Logging 6.0: Key Differences from Previous Versions (5.0-5.9)

OpenShift Logging 6.0 introduces several significant changes compared to previous versions, streamlining the logging architecture and enhancing the overall logging experience.

== Simplified Architecture

* **Removal of Elasticsearch and Fluentd:**  OpenShift Logging 6.0 eliminates Elasticsearch and Fluentd as default components, streamlining the architecture for improved performance and reduced complexity.
* **Focus on Loki and Vector:** The logging stack now centers around Loki for log aggregation and Vector for log collection and forwarding, providing a more unified and efficient solution.

== Enhanced Scalability and Performance

* **Horizontal Scalability:** Loki's architecture allows for seamless horizontal scaling, ensuring that the logging system can handle the growing demands of large-scale OpenShift deployments.
* **Improved Query Performance:** Loki's indexing and query mechanisms are optimized for speed, enabling faster log retrieval and analysis.

== Enhanced User Experience

* **Streamlined Configuration:** The removal of Elasticsearch and Fluentd simplifies the configuration process, making it easier to set up and manage your logging infrastructure.
* **Improved Integration:** Loki and Vector offer tighter integration with OpenShift, providing a more seamless and native logging experience.

== Additional Enhancements

* **Expanded Log Sources:** Vector's flexibility allows you to collect logs from an even wider range of sources, providing greater visibility into your OpenShift environment.
* **Enhanced Log Processing:** Vector's processing capabilities have been expanded, enabling you to perform more complex log transformations and filtering.

== Transitioning to OpenShift Logging 6.0

If you're upgrading from a previous version of OpenShift Logging, the transition to 6.0 will involve migrating your existing log data and reconfiguring your logging pipeline to utilize Loki and Vector.
