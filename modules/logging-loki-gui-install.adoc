= Installing {loki-op} using the {product-title} web console

To install and configure logging on your {product-title} cluster, additional Operators must be installed. This can be done from the Operator Hub within the web console.

{Product-title} Operators use custom resources (CR) to manage applications and their components. High-level configuration and settings are provided by the user within a CR. The Operator translates high-level directives into low-level actions, based on best practices embedded within the Operatorâ€™s logic. A custom resource definition (CRD) defines a CR and lists all the configurations available to users of the Operator. Installing an Operator creates the CRDs, which are then used to generate CRs.

.Prerequisites

* Supported object store (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, Swift, Minio, OpenShift Data Foundation)

.Procedure

. To install the {loki-op} in the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Type {loki-op} in the filter by keyword box. Choose *Loki Operator* from the list of available Operators and click *Install*.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Community Loki Operator is not supported by Red Hat.
====

. On the *Install Operator* page, for *Update channel* select *stable*.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `stable` channel only provides updates to the most recent release of logging. To continue receiving updates for prior releases, you must change your subscription channel to `stable-X` where `X` is the version of logging you have installed.
====
+
As the {loki-op} must be deployed to the global operator group namespace `openshift-operators-redhat`, *Installation mode* and *Installed Namespace* is already selected. If this namespace does not already exist, it is created for you.

. Select *Enable operator-recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace.*
+
This option sets the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` label in the Namespace object. You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace.

. For *Update approval* select *Automatic*, then click *Install*.
+
If the approval strategy in the subscription is set to *Automatic*, the update process initiates as soon as a new Operator version is available in the selected channel. If the approval strategy is set to *Manual*, you must manually approve pending updates.

. Create a LokiStack instance:

.. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

.. Select *LokiOperator* then the *LokiStack* tab.

.. Select *Create LokiStack*
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Form view* does not include all available options. The *YAML view* is recommended for completing your setup.
====

.. Select *YAML view* and use the template below:
+
[source,yaml]

<1> Supported size options for production instances of Loki are `1x.small` and `1x.medium`.
<2> Enter the name of your log store secret.
<3> Enter the type of your log store secret.
<4> Enter the name of an existing storage class for temporary storage. For best performance, specify a storage class that allocates block storage. Available storage classes for your cluster can be listed using `oc get storageclasses`.

.. Click *Create*.

.Verification

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Make sure the *openshift-logging* project is selected.
. In the *Status* column, verify that you see green checkmarks with *InstallSucceeded* and the text *Up to date*.

[NOTE]
====
An Operator might display a `Failed` status before the installation finishes. If the Operator install completes with an `InstallSucceeded` message, refresh the page.
