== Bug fixes
* Before this update, the collector relied upon the default config setting when reading container log lines. This resulted in the collector not efficiently reading rotated files an high volume clusters and holding onto deleted file handles for a long time. This update increases the number of bytes read allowing the collector to more efficiently process rotated files. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3949[LOG-3949])
