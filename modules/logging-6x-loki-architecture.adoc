= Loki Architecture: Understanding the Components

Loki's architecture is comprised of several key components, each playing a specific role in log processing and storage:

* **Distributor:** Receives incoming logs from Vector agents and distributes them across multiple Ingesters.
* **Ingester:**  Responsible for building chunks of log data and creating an index for efficient retrieval.
* **Querier:** Processes incoming log queries and fetches relevant log data from the storage backend.
* **Query Frontend:**  Manages and coordinates incoming queries, distributes the workload across Queriers, and returns the results to the user.
* **Storage Backend:** Stores the log chunks and indexes, often using object storage services like S3 or GCS.
