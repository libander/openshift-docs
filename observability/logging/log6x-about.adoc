This release of Cluster Logging requires administrators to explicitly grant log collection permissions to the service account associated with *ClusterLogForwarder*. This was not required in previous releases for the legacy logging scenario consisting of a *ClusterLogging* and, optionally, a *ClusterLogForwarder.logging.openshift.io* resource.

To use the existing service account (that is, `logcollector`) from a previous release, create the following *ClusterRoleBinding*:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user collect-application-logs -z openshift-logging:logcollector
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user collect-infrastructure-logs -z openshift-logging:logcollector
----

Additionally, create the following *ClusterRoleBinding* if collecting audit logs:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user collect-audit-logs -z openshift-logging:logcollector
----
