= About upgrading to Logging 6.0

OpenShift Container Platform logging version 6.0 introduces significant changes to improve flexibility and control for cluster administrators. This release decouples logging components, updates the log storage solution, and introduces a new API for log forwarding configuration.

Logging 6.0 includes the following key changes:

* Separate operators for logging components
* Loki-based log storage
* Vector as the log collector
* New API in the `observability.openshift.io` group for log forwarding

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrading to Logging 6.0 is a manual process. The `cluster-logging-operator` does not provide an automated upgrade path.
====

This documentation explains the changes in Logging 6.0 and provides instructions for upgrading your logging infrastructure. It includes:

* Overview of architectural changes
* Deployment steps for the new logging stack
* Configuration examples for common logging scenarios

Understanding these changes will help you maintain your log management capabilities during and after the upgrade to Logging 6.0.
