====
Do not use memory ballooning in {product-title} clusters. Memory ballooning can cause cluster-wide instabilities, service degradation, or other undefined behaviors.

* Control plane machines should have committed memory equal to or greater than the published minimum resource requirements for a cluster installation.

* Compute machines should have a minimum reservation equal to or greater than the published minimum resource requirements for a cluster installation.

These minimum CPU and memory requirements do not account for resources required by user workloads.

For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase article link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7074533[Memory Ballooning and OpenShift].
