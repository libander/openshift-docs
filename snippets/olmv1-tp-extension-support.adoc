[IMPORTANT]
====
{olmv1} does not support dependency resolution. If an extension declares dependencies for other APIs or packages, the dependencies must be present on the cluster before you attempt to install the extension.

Currently, {olmv1} supports the installation of extensions that meet the following criteria:

* The extension must use the `AllNamespaces` install mode.
* The extension must not use webhooks.

Cluster extensions that use webhooks or that target a single or specified set of namespaces cannot be installed.
